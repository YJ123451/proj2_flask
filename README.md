# Flask Webpage: Learning to accept, enqueue and process POST requests
Hi! This is a project where I create a webpage using Python's Flask module, with HTML, JS, and CSS for formatting purposes. 
This webpage was made to accept POST reqeusts containing an integer, enqueue and process the request, calculate the factorial of said integer, and display the input, result, and timestamp of when the request was processed.
This project also uses an sqllite databse to store the requests into a log, which it then pulls from this log to display the information on the frontend.
